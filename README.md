# Data-Analysis
Using the dataset “diabetes.CSV” dataset which is a metabolic disease in which the body’s inability to produce insulin causes elevated levels of glucose in the blood.

## Plot 1:
 - A scatterplot between “Insulin” and “Glucose” to study the relationship between the two. Label the plot with “Relation between Glucose and Insulin”, X-axis with “Insulin Concentration" and Y-axis with “Glucose”. 
 
## Plot 2:
 - Histogram of Glucose value in blood in range from 50 to 150 and divides it to 20 breakpoints. X-axis labeled with “Glucose Value”. Having main label “Glucose value in blood”.
   
## Plot 3: 
 - Visualize “BloodPressure” Variable and show the outliers in the BloodPressure vector.

## Plot 4:
 - Bar plot of the maximum “Insulin” dose grouped per age of patient.

## Plot 5:
 - A table for the “Pregnancies” attribute, then a bar plot.

## Plot 6:
 - mean, median, min, max of the Insulin dose using one pie chart with labels.

## Plot 7:
 - For the two attributes “DiabetesPedigreeFunction” and “Age” of the data frame “diabetes.csv”, The distribution using density plots with titles “Diabetes Pedigree Function Distribution” and “Age Distribution” respectively.

## Plot 8:
 - Visualize using dot plot the “DiabetesPedigreeFunction” per “outcome” attribute.

## Plot 9:
 - the pairwise relationships for the following five attributes in one graph: Insulin, Age, Glucose, BloodPressure and DiabetesPedigreeFunction.

## Plot 10:
 - Combining all of the graphics from 1-8 and display them as three plots per Column.
